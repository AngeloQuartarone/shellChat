# shellChat

## Description
This project is a command-line chat application developed in Rust, designed to work exclusively on a local network. The primary goal of this project is to provide a simple local network chat application while offering a solid foundation for exploring Rustâ€™s features, including UDP socket management and concurrent programming.

## Educational purpose
This project is created for educational purposes to learn Rust and gain practical experience in building network applications. In the future, the project will be expanded to include security features to ensure the privacy and integrity of transmitted data.

Currently, the project does not include advanced security measures. However, future plans include:
- Message Encryption: Implementing encryption to ensure the confidentiality of exchanged messages.
- Authentication and Authorization: Adding authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access the chat.
